\section{\underline{Introduction:-}}\large ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a user’s input. ChatterBot uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses. This makes it easy for developers to create chat bots and automate conversations with users.\par An important concept in public health research is that from time to time a new technology or approach to obtain the best possible data, or the application of a new service or tool, will make such an impact that it is then used in education and routinely used in practice for decades. Humans have for many centuries sought ways to automate with machines: in fact, the first humanoid-robot was invented by Arab inventor Al-Jazari, of the Turkish dynasty of Artukids, in 1206 AD.

\section{\underline{Objective:-}}\textbf{1. }Chatbots are mainly used to provide customer support.\\
\textbf{2. }It helps in catering a huge amount of target audience at the same time 24/7.\\\textbf{3. }If you are a company that’s functional all around the world, you get hands-on chatbot asap! Because, while you are asleep, your bot can entertain your customers anywhere in the world.
\\\textbf{4. }Chatbots are very intelligent. You train them once and they will communicate with your target audience in their language\\\textbf{5. }Chatbots are very intelligent. You train them once and they will communicate with your target audience in their language.

\section{\underline{Feasibility Study:-}}The analysis is carried out by our in-house experts and is completely tailor-made. Through this analysis, for example, you will gain insight into the response times, peak times and opening times of your organisation and you will discover all the wonderful benefits of a chatbot. It’s also possible to utilize the number of webcare messages in order to determine the proportion of messages that a chatbot could pick up.
\section{\underline{Methodology/Planning Of Work:-}}As with any software product or software development tools, there are many avenues one can take to solve a problem or implement a solution. In this section we review several of the larger segment bot tools available that have been in use, but it should be noted that the bot development market is still developing and different toolsets can emerge. During the time of writing of this paper, several new chatbot developer tools began have begun to gain traction, including Oracle, Rulai and Nuance Communications.The authors utilized this analysis to decide on which chatbot development environment and toolset to create a sample chatbot.
\section{\underline{Facilities Required For Proposed Work:-}}chatterbot is a software based project and their is no need of any hardware.for the development of this project we have use python compiler software pycharm.

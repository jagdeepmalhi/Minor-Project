The project aims to develop a Typing speed game .Type-go helps to  improve the typing speed of a person.
It has been designed to provide a better typing experience with your friends .
Users can interact with the help of room. A private room id will be created for the interaction. 
Type go help  you type with your friend and help in being competitive. as long as you type it will give you Signal where you typed wrong and give you score when you finished.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We had a great experience working on this project and we got to learn
a plethora of new skills through this project. However, it would not
have been possible without the kind support and help of many individuals.
We would like to extend our sincere thanks to all of them. We are
highly indebted to the teachers and especially Prof.Hanit Karwal for
their guidance and constant supervision as well as providing necessary
information regarding the project and also for their support in completing
the project.

We would like to express our gratitude towards our parents and friends
for their kind cooperation and encouragement which help us in the
completion of the project.

\section{Conclusion and Future Scope}

Through this voice assistant, we have automated various services using
a single line command. It eases most of the tasks of the user like
searching the web, retrieving weather forecast details, vocabulary
help and medical related queries. We aim to make this project a complete
server assistant and make it smart enough to act as a replacement
for a general server administration. The future plans include integrating
Jarvis with mobile using React Native to provide a synchronised experience
between the two connected devices. Further, in the long run, Jarvis
is planned to feature auto deployment supporting elastic beanstalk,
backup files, and all operations which a general Server Administrator
does. The functionality would be seamless enough to replace the Server
Administrator with Jarvis.
